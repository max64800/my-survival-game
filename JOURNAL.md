# Build Journal — Dwarf Game

Our diary of building the game: what we did, what went wrong, and how we fixed it.

## Day 1 — November 13–14, 2026: Planning

**What we did**
- Picked the idea: a 3D survival game where you play a dwarf, all underground.
- Answered lots of multiple-choice questions to decide the big stuff:
  - It might be sold on Steam one day, so all free art must be allowed in paid games.
  - The look is a Valheim + Grounded mix.
  - Up to 4 friends can play together through Steam.
  - The caves are new and random every game.
  - You can dig anywhere, and the walls stay smooth.
  - The camera sits behind the dwarf.
  - Building uses snap pieces, plus a special **blueprint + chest** idea.
  - Fighting has combos and parries, and shield parries stun enemies more.
  - Survival means hunger, thirst and monsters.
- Picked **Godot** as the game engine because Claude can build almost all of it as text files.
- Made a 7-step roadmap. Step 1 is "First Tunnel" (dig and explore).
- Wrote the plan: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-14-dwarf-survival-game-design.md`

**Hurdles / mistakes**
- The project folder was empty, so Claude couldn't look at our older game "Deep Rise" for ideas. Not a real problem. We just started fresh.
- Big hurdle we saw coming: co-op is the hardest thing to add late. **Fix:** we moved "Friends" to Step 2 and will build Step 1 "co-op ready."

**Setting up the workshop (later on Day 1)**
- Turned on **git** "save points" and connected the project to GitHub (`max64800/my-survival-game`).
- Installed **Godot 4.7.2** (the official version).
- Gave Claude new helpers:
  - **Godot MCP** lets Claude start the game and read its error messages by itself.
  - **GodotPrompter** is a pack of Godot know-how.
- Good news: we checked, and both the digging add-on (Voxel Tools) and the Steam add-on (GodotSteam) now plug into the normal Godot. So the biggest risk in our plan got much smaller.

**Hurdles / mistakes**
- **Mistake caught:** the first time Claude connected Godot MCP, it saved a settings file *inside the project* that had your computer's username in it. Your GitHub repo is **public**, so that would have shown up online. **Fix:** Claude moved the setting to a private spot on your computer and deleted the file before saving to GitHub.
- Small one: Windows didn't create a short `godot` command, because that needs admin rights. Not a problem. Claude just uses the full path to Godot.
- Heads-up: the GitHub repo is **public**, so anyone can see the code. That's fine for now. If you want to sell the game later, we can switch it to private with one click.

**Next**
- You read the plan and say yes (or ask for changes).
- Claude writes the step-by-step build list for Step 1.
