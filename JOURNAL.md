# Build Journal — Dwarf Game

Our diary of building the game: what we did, what went wrong, and how we fixed it.

---

## Day 1 — November 13–14, 2026: Planning

**What we did**
- Picked the idea: a 3D survival game where you play a dwarf, all underground.
- Answered lots of multiple-choice questions to decide the big stuff:
  - It might be sold on Steam one day, so all free art must be allowed in paid games.
  - The look is a Valheim + Grounded mix.
  - Up to 4 friends can play together through Steam.
  - The caves are new and random every game.
  - You can dig anywhere, and the walls stay smooth.
  - The camera sits behind the dwarf.
  - Building uses snap pieces, plus a special **blueprint + chest** idea.
  - Fighting has combos and parries, and shield parries stun enemies more.
  - Survival means hunger, thirst and monsters.
- Picked **Godot** as the game engine because Claude can build almost all of it as text files.
- Made a 7-step roadmap. Step 1 is "First Tunnel" (dig and explore).
- Wrote the plan: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-14-dwarf-survival-game-design.md`

**Hurdles / mistakes**
- The project folder was empty, so Claude couldn't look at our older game "Deep Rise" for ideas. Not a real problem. We just started fresh.
- Big hurdle we saw coming: co-op is the hardest thing to add late. **Fix:** we moved "Friends" to Step 2 and will build Step 1 "co-op ready."

**Next**
- You read the plan and say yes (or ask for changes).
- Claude writes the step-by-step build list for Step 1.
- Install Godot.
