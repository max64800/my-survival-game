# Project rules for Claude

Underground dwarf survival game (3D, up to 4-player Steam co-op), built in **Godot 4.7.2** with GDScript.
Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-14-dwarf-survival-game-design.md`

## The owner's two rules
1. **Journal everything.** After every work session, add an entry to `JOURNAL.md`: what we did, every mistake and hurdle (including Claude's own), and how it was fixed.
2. **5th-grade explanations.** The owner does not code. Explain everything simply: short sentences, everyday comparisons, define any tech word the first time.

## Working rules
- Build in the roadmap order. Each step must be playable before the next starts.
- Keep gameplay actions "co-op ready": request → host approves → everyone updates.
- Only use assets licensed for commercial use (prefer CC0). Log every asset in `CREDITS.md`.
- Never copy names, characters, art, maps, or music from other games.
- The GitHub repo is public: never commit personal paths, usernames, keys, or Steam credentials.
- Use Voxel Tools and GodotSteam **GDExtension** editions with the official Godot build (never the module builds).
- Use the `godot` MCP to run the game and read errors; use GodotPrompter skills for Godot patterns.
